 Tech Stack
Python 3
Streamlit (if used) or Console-based
Health formula logic


 How It Works
User inputs height (cm or inches) and weight (kg or pounds)


It uses the BMI formula:
   BMI  = weight (kg)/ (height (m))2



  It classifies the result using WHO guidelines:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal: 18.5–24.9
Overweight: 25–29.9
Obese: 30+


 Features
Simple, interactive input system
Instant BMI calculation
Dynamic health feedback message

Can be extended with health tips or visuals


 What I Learned
This project helped me solidify my knowledge of basic data logic, user input handling, and health-based classification systems. It was a great exercise in combining real-world impact with beginner-level code.
